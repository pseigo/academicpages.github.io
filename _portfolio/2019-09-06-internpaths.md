This was a small project I did with three other attendees of the nwHacks 2019 hackathon. I contributed many of the core ideas in brainstorming, designed UI mockups, and created much of the front end interface with React and Ant Design. I had never used JavaScript before this event, let alone React. I worked close with my team members and did my best to ensure clear communication. I learned so much from this event and Jason offered a lot of insight into backend operations using Node.js.
