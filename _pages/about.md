A Computer Science student pursuing software. Among my volunteer commitments and seasonal positions, I have experience as a freelance portrait photographer, arranging photo shoots for clients from individuals to non-profit organizations.

In my spare time, you'll find me taking photos, playing guitar, or programming. Technology has always been an interesting part of my life and I can't wait to do amazing things with a passionate team of like-minded people.

Most of my experience is with C++ and Java and I am currently exploring the Elixir programming language.  I am looking to work with passionate individuals to build something great.

## Computer Science

I am a second year Computer Science student at UBC Vancouver searching for internship opportunities. In addition to my software projects, I am acquiring many fundamental Computer Science concepts through my studies. You can visit the UBC course calendar to view a brief description of each course.
