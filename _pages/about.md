A Computer Science student pursuing software. Until my next study term, I am currently working full-time as a software developer intern. Later on, I will be exploring co-op/internship opportunities in Calgary and Vancouver during the summers of 2022 and 2023.

Among my volunteer commitments and seasonal positions, I have experience as a freelance portrait photographer, arranging photo shoots for clients from individuals to non-profit organizations.

In my spare time, you'll find me taking photos, playing guitar, or programming. Technology has always been an interesting part of my life and I can't wait to do amazing things with a passionate team of like-minded people.

Most of my experience is with C++ and Java and I am currently exploring the Elixir programming language. I am looking to work with passionate individuals to build something great.

## Contact

You can get in touch with me through email, which is my first name at this domain. 

## University 

I am a second year Computer Science student at UBC Vancouver. In addition to my software projects, I am developing fundamental Computer Science concepts through my studies. You can visit the links below to view a brief description of each course.
