I am a student pursuing software. In my spare time, you'll find me taking photos, playing guitar, or programming. Technology has always been an interesting part of my life and I can't wait to do amazing things with a passionate team of like-minded people.

Most of my experience is with C++, with basic knowledge in Java and Elixir. I am interested in building larger applications and expanding my skills.
